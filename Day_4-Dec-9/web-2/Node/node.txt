How node.js run time is created?
back in the the days google created v8 engine to run js code in their browser.
but to run in the local machines there was no run time. 
Some smart developers,took the v8 engine out from the google and added some functionalities to run in our local pc's.
So,thats how a node.JS run time is created.

Bun folks are creating a new run time without using v8 engine.
They are writing in a low level programming language called ZIG.
