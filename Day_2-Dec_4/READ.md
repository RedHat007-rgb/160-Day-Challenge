# JavaScript Synchronous and Asynchronous Examples

This folder demonstrates the basic concepts of synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript, including examples of arithmetic operations, user input, and file I/O operations.


The project contains various examples to illustrate:
- Basic arithmetic operations.
- User input handling using `prompt-sync`.
- Synchronous file reading using `fs.readFileSync`.
- Basic usage of functions inside objects.
- Synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript.

Myfirstasync.js file contains the basic asynchronous program.
